// Wait, I am writing `e:\hasilkuuy\MARKET\src\app\api\cron\medanpedia-status\route.ts`...
// Oh, the previous `write_to_file` call had "Step Id: 83" which means it was executed.
// But the tool output showed "Step Id: 83 Created file ...".
// So it is created.
// Why did I think it wasn't?
// Ah, I see "Step Id: 86" EPHEMERAL MESSAGE.
// I will assume it's done.
// But wait, there was a `replace_file_content` in Step 82 for admin page.
// And `write_to_file` in Step 83 for cron.
// And `list_dir` in Step 81 for product.
// So all good.
